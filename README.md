## Getting Started

### Application
    npm install
    npm start

We're using [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) to generate our style guide. It's configured to pick up any element matching the file pattern ```src/elements/**/*.js```

    npm run styleguide
    open http://localhost:6060/
